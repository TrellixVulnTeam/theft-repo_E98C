Information Problem: To investigating the relationship between auto theft versus other types of theft in Prince George’s County. Using both location, crime rate, and comparisons between multiple types of theft compared to auto theft and where these crimes are most likely to occur.

Stakeholders: The stakeholders will be Prince George’s County and the people that live in the area to help them make better informed decisions in order to avoid being victims of theft. It will also help them by assessing longevity of criminal activity within Prince George’s County depending on crime frequency in the dataset over several years. 

Dataset: Prince George's County API - https://data.princegeorgescountymd.gov/

Project Solution: This application will help those who live in Prince George’s county be able to recognize potentially dangerous area around where they may live or interact with. Also potentially helping the police/government help put into place some types of actions that may lead to a decrease of auto theft in these higher traffic areas. As a group, we hope to shed light on how the sector or location of the crime influences the form of theft committed to better understand why these crimes occur and how to best avoid and/or stop these crimes.


Technological Choices Rationale: 
Figma: To create the wireframe of our website to then be used to make it a reality. 
Visual Studio Code: To write the code for making the actual website.
GitHub Desktop: To share code with one another 
Excel: To view Prince George’s County crime data
R Studios: To perform data manipulations
 
How This Solution Helped Solve the Problem: Our applications allows for the residents of PG County to visually see where theft occurs and helps them avoid or prevent these crimes from taking place due to the knowledge of where it is likely to occur.

Challenges Faced: 
We had trouble figuring out how to use the wireframe platform, Figma, but there was a learning curve to understanding it
Trouble trying to get the site to link with heroku servers
There was an issue with formatting the website and aligning it to our specific
needs relating to the wireframe we created

Possible Future Work: We would expand our project to other areas on a larger scale to provide a service to multiple locations to help the states to develop a better patrol method
